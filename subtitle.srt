0:00:01.320000 --> 0:00:05.080000
hi everybody i've spoken and a lot of events over the years

2
0:00:05.560000 --> 0:00:08.920000
including some with pretty impressive lineup but i've

3
0:00:09 --> 0:00:13.400000
never been part of the same program as pope francis black

4
0:00:13.560000 --> 0:00:19
pink and spunge bob square parenants i am a little star truck

5
0:00:19.640000 --> 0:00:23.910000
but the fact that all of them are part of this along with a lot

6
0:00:23.910000 --> 0:00:27.310000
of other folks should tell you how important this fight

7
0:00:27.390000 --> 0:00:31.470000
against climate change really is of course you already know

8
0:00:32.190000 --> 0:00:36.470000
you see it in the reports about hundred your flos or record

9
0:00:36.470000 --> 0:00:40.510000
breaking wildfires or severe droughts many of you are

10
0:00:40.590000 --> 0:00:44.190000
feeling the effects of climate change every day and if we

11
0:00:44.190000 --> 0:00:49.550000
don't do something about it things will only get worse now

12
0:00:49.710000 --> 0:00:52.670000
the easiest thing to do would be to throwp your hands and hope

13
0:00:52.670000 --> 0:00:56.470000
that somebody else solves problem that's what some people

14
0:00:56.470000 --> 0:00:59.830000
in my generation of done but don't think you're going to do

15
0:00:59.830000 --> 0:01:03.860000
that andthen here's why when you look at the history of so

16
0:01:03.860000 --> 0:01:06.420000
many social movements whether it's the civil rights

17
0:01:06.420000 --> 0:01:10.420000
movement or decolonization around the world or anti war

18
0:01:10.580000 --> 0:01:14.660000
movements they're often started and sustained by young

19
0:01:14.740000 --> 0:01:18.260000
people that's because you understand what dr king called

20
0:01:18.580000 --> 0:01:23.860000
the fierce urgency of now you don't see the way things are and

21
0:01:23.860000 --> 0:01:27.540000
assume that's the way they'll always be you can imagine

22
0:01:27.700000 --> 0:01:30.700000
something different and you're willing to put in the work to

23
0:01:30.700000 --> 0:01:34.900000
make it happen that's what makes me hopeful about the fight

24
0:01:34.980000 --> 0:01:38.540000
against climate change through the obama foundation i've

25
0:01:38.540000 --> 0:01:41.940000
had the chance to meet folks like you or helping to protect

26
0:01:41.940000 --> 0:01:46.450000
our planet what i've been so impressed by is the fact that you

27
0:01:46.450000 --> 0:01:49.930000
are't waiting for the people who got us into this mess to dig

28
0:01:49.930000 --> 0:01:54.770000
us out you're doing it yourself even if you're not old enough

29
0:01:54.770000 --> 0:01:57.690000
to mote you're knocking on doors for candidates who will

30
0:01:57.690000 --> 0:02:01.130000
take action on climate change and then holding them account

31
0:02:01.690000 --> 0:02:04.530000
you're demanding that companies stop being part of the

32
0:02:04.530000 --> 0:02:07.690000
problem and start being part of the solution and you're

33
0:02:07.690000 --> 0:02:11.450000
encouraging friends family and anyone else you know to join

34
0:02:11.450000 --> 0:02:17.730000
the movement all of us have to find our own path to service no

35
0:02:17.730000 --> 0:02:21.570000
one can do it for you but if enough young people make their

36
0:02:21.570000 --> 0:02:25.600000
voices heard that's how progress gets made that's how

37
0:02:25.600000 --> 0:02:30.240000
things move forward even on a problem as big and complicated

38
0:02:30.320000 --> 0:02:34.080000
and difficult to climate change maybe especially on a

39
0:02:34.080000 --> 0:02:37.480000
problem like that so just like you wouldn't let your

40
0:02:37.480000 --> 0:02:40.520000
grandparents pick the music you listen to or the close you

41
0:02:40.520000 --> 0:02:45.600000
where don't let anyone else decide your future put yourself

42
0:02:45.680000 --> 0:02:50.080000
out there take a risk and imagine a better future and help

43
0:02:50.160000 --> 0:02:55.720000
make it real because the world is counting on you i'm

44
0:02:55.720000 --> 0:03:00.880000
counting on you spun and black pink are counting on you and

45
0:03:00.880000 --> 0:03:02.080000
there's no time to waste
